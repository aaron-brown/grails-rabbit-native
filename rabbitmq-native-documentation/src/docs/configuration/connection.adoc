=== Server Connection

The plugin expects the connection configuration to the RabbitMQ server to be defined. A bare minimum configuration
example looks like:

.application.groovy
[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
rabbitmq {
    connections = [
        [
            name: "defaultConnection",
            host: "example.com",
            username: "foo",
            password: "bar"
        ]
    ]
}

.application.yml
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
rabbitmq:
    connections:
      - name: defaultConnection
        host: example.com
        username: foo
        password: bar

The `connections` section should contain a list of maps, where each entry in the list represents an individual
connection.

Connections to many different RabbitMQ servers can be configured.  A multi-server configuration looks like:

.application.groovy
[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
rabbitmq {
    connections = [
        [
            name: "connection1",
            host: "rabbit1.example.com",
            username: "foo",
            password: "bar"
        ],
        [
            name: "connection2",
            host: "rabbit2.example.com",
            username: "foo",
            password: "bar"
        ]
    ]
}

.application.yml
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
-----
rabbitmq:
    connections:
      - name: connection1
        host: rabbit1.example.com
        username: foo
        password: bar

      - name: connection2
        host: rabbit2.example.com
        username: foo
        password: bar

The following table enumerates all the configuration options available to the connection configuration:

[grid="rows"]
|===
| Configuration Property | Required | Description | Type | Default
| `name` | | Name of the connection, which can be used to tie queues and exchanges to a particular connection. | `String` | _none_
| `host` | image:check.svg[36,36] | Hostname or IP address of the RabbitMQ server to connect to. | `String` | _none_
| `username` | image:check.svg[36,36] | Username to log into the RabbitMQ server with. | `String` | _none_
| `password` | image:check.svg[36,36] | Password to log into the RabbitMQ server with. | `String` | _none_
| `isDefault` | | A connection with this set to true will be the server messages are sent to if no specific connection is specified when sending the message. | `boolean` | `false`
| `port` | | Port to connect to the RabbitMQ server with. | `Integer` | 5672
