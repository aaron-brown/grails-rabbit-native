h1. body

h2. Purpose

Body of the message to send to the RabbitMQ server.

h2. Examples

{code}
new RabbitMessageBuilder().send {
    queue = "example.queue"
    body = "test message"
}
{code}

h2. Description

The body is a required part of the message to transmit. The RabbitMQ server expects the message to be in a byte array format, but the plugin attempts to handle the conversion of objects for you via the
[MessageConverter|guide:converters] objects. You may assign any type of object to this property as long as there is a message converter available to convert the object to a byte array.
