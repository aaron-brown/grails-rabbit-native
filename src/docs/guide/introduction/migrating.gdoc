This plugin was created to provide closer integration with the native RabbitMQ Java library, and remove the Spring Framework
RabbitMQ layer utilized by the official Grails RabbitMQ plugin. This plugin follows many of its conventions, but it also
does some things very differently. If you are migrating from the official plugin to this one, please keep in mind that while
many things may work similarly, there are small changes that need to be accounted for. Also note that not all features of
the official plugin are present in this one, and visa versa.
