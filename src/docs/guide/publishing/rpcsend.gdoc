Publishing an RPC message is as easy as sending messages, except the returned message is returned from the function.

h4. RPC Example
{code}
// Send a message
def result = new RabbitMessageBuilder().rpc {
    queue = 'some.queue'
    body = 'hi!'
    timeout = RabbitMessageBuilder.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
}
{code}

While this documentation will not deep-dive into the configuration options for the builder, the timeout option is especially important for RPC-style messages. The
timeout property is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the client will wait for the server to respond. If the timeout is reached, a @TimeoutException@ will be
thrown. If the timeout is set to 0, the client will wait indefinitely for a response. The default value of the timeout, if not passed, is 5 seconds.
