Sending a message means publishing a message to an exchange or queue and not waiting for a response (fire and forget). The only required parameters to the builder
are a queue or exchange to publish the message to, and the body of the message.

h4. Send Example
{code}
// Send a message
new RabbitMessageBuilder().send {
    queue = 'some.queue'
    body = 'hi!'
}
{code}

RabbitMQ expects the body of a message to be a byte array. The message converters will also work when publishing messages, so if an object type other than @byte[]@ is
encountered, a suitable message converter will be found and run against the message body, if one exists.
