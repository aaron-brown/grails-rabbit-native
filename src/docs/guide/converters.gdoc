Message converters are classes that are responsible for converting objects to and from byte arrays. The plugin provides 4 built-in converters that cover basic types:

* @Integer@
* @Map@
* @List@
* @String@

These converters allow message handlers to consume and return data without having to convert that data themselves. They are also used with the @RabbitMessageBuilder@ class.
