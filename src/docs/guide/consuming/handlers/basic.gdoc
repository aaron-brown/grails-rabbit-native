In its most basic form, a message handler method takes in the body of the received message, and a @MessageContext@
object that contains the message parameters received from the RabbitMQ server, along with the consumer's channel
that the handler should publish messages through.

This is the most generic form of a message handler:
{code}
package com.example

class ExampleConsumer {
    // ...

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Do work
    }
}
{code}
