Subscribing to a exchanges is different from subscribing to queues, as there are different types of exchanges with different behavior.
RabbitMQ's libraries do not provide a direct way to subscribe to an exchange, but rather the method to use this functionality is to create
a queue that is bound to an exchange. This plugin provides a convenience configuration method that handles the queue creation and binding for you.
The binding requirements differ between the different types of exchanges.

There are 2 types of exchanges that consumers can subscribe to via this plugin:

* Fanout
* Topic
