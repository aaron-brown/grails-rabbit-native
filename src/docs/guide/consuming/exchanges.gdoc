Subscribing to a exchanges is different from subscribing to queues, as there are different types of exchanges with different behavior.
RabbitMQ's libraries do not provide a direct way to subscribe to an exchange, however the plugin provides a way to subscribe to exchanges directly by creating
a temporary queue that is bound to an exchange. The binding requirements differ between the different types of exchanges.

There are 2 types of exchanges that consumers can subscribe to via this plugin:

* Fanout
* Topic
