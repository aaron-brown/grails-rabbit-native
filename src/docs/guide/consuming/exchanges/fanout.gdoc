A fanout exchange will forward a received message to every queue bound to it. There is no binding criteria for this kind of exchange.
This is the simplest type of exchange, and is also the easiest to configure.

Fanout Example:
{code}
package com.example

class ExampleConsumer {
    static rabbitConfig = [
        'exchange': 'fanout.exchange'
    ]

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Process message
    }
}
{code}
